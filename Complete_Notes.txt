Speed is the distance travelled in a unit time
Velocity includes a direction and speed
Speed = Distance / Time
Acceleration is how fast you are speeding up or slowing down
The area under a Velocity/Time graph is the distance travelled
Stopping Distance = Thinking Distance + Braking Distance
Thinking Distance - Distance travelled between noticing the hazard and braking
Braking Distance - Distance Car travels when brakes applied
Factors Affecting Stopping distance - Fatigue, Drugs, Distractions, Age, weather
Speed Control - Speed Cameras (now and average), Sleeping Policemen, Speed limits
Car Safety - Crumple Zones, Safety Belts, Safety Cages and Aribags
Crumple Zones - Collapse gradually on impact, reducing decceleraction
Safety Belts - Stretch slightly to increase time
Saftey Cages - Area of cars that will not collapse, proteccting occupants
Airbags - Inflate on impact, increasing decceleration time for body
When a force acts upon a moving body, energy is transferred, but the total amount of energy remains constant
When an object is moved, work will need to be done on it to move
Work Done = Force x Distance Moved (Joules = Newtons x Metres)
Work done = Energy transferred
Kinetic energy is movement energy
kinetic energy = 1/2 x mass x speed^2
Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) is energy stored in an object because of it's height
If it can fall, It's got GPE
GPE = Mass x Gravity x Height
Improving Efficiency - Rolling resistance, Idling Losses, inertial losses
Motion of objects can be modelled using equations
V = U + at | a = acceleration, U = initial Velocity, v = final velocity, x = distance, t = time
x = Ut + 1/2at^2 | a = acceleration, U = initial Velocity, v = final velocity, x = distance, t = time
x = (u=v)/2 x t | a = acceleration, U = initial Velocity, v = final velocity, x = distance, t = time
v^2 = u^2 + 2ax | a = acceleration, U = initial Velocity, v = final velocity, x = distance, t = time
Momentm - mass and velocty = momentum
Momentum = mass x velocity (kgm/s = kg x m/s)
Conservation of momentum - In any collision or explosion, momentum is conserved
The principle of conservation of momentum: total momentum before collision = momentum after collision
Force = Change in momentum / time taken
In elastic collisions, the total K.E is conserved
In a gas, collisions between molecules are elastic
Inelastic Collisions (most collisions) do not conserve K.E, some energy is converted to heat and sound
Moments are forces acting around a pivot
Moments can be reffered to as turning forces
moment = force x distance from pivot (Nm = N x m)
Principle of moments: if sum of clockwise moments = anitclockwise moments, then object is balanced
To draw a force, use arrows to show size and direction
Resultant force is the overall force acting on the object
4N <====[]==> 2N   Resultant Force = 2N Left
A force can start or stop something moving, change a shape, direction and speed
Newton's 1st Law: Balanced Forces Mean No Change In Velocity
Newton's 1st Law is about balanced forces, and is linked to inertia
Newton's 2nd Law: If there is an unbalanced force then the object will accelerate
Newton's 2nd Law regards unbalanced forces
F = MA --> Resultant force = Mass x Acceleration
The acceleration of a body is directly propertional to the resultant force or it's inversely proportional
Newton's 3rd Law: For every force there is an equal and opposite reaction force
A light year is the distance light travels in a year
8 planets
an asteroid is left over material from the formation of the solar system
Asteroids vary in size from a pebble to 1000km dia.
Asteroids are mainly found in the asteroid belt between jupiter and mars
Some asteroids have their own moons
Comets are big, dirty snowballs made from dust and ice
Comets are around 1 to 40km wide
Comets are often found in he kuiper belt and the oort cloud
Comet's tails get longer as they apporach the sun as more is melted
Comets speed up approaching the sun due to more gravity
Forces in stars is gravity inwards and nuclear fusion outwards
Stars are made from dust and gas
The goldilocks zone is the orbital range where a planet is far enough away to allow water to form
The solar system ends at around 125000 AU, where there is no gravitational pull anymore
Star > red giant > white Dwarf > Red Dwarf > black Dwarf
Star > red supergiant > supernova > Nebula/neutron star/black hole
Stars are formed from nebulau - gravity causes nebulau to collapse, heat + pressure > fusion!
The HR diagram shows relations between stars
The big bang happened around 14bn years ago
galaxies on the edge of the universe travel faster than the ones on the inside
Evidence of the big bang - CMBR, E=MC^2, Horn Antenna
Red Shift - the faster a light source moves the further the red shift
red shift happens because the wavelengths are stretched due to the speed
Edwin Hubble came up with the idea of red shiftAll organisms vary
viruses are not considered to be living
The 5 kingdoms - Monera, Bacteria, Fungi, Plants, Animals

Each new cell needs a set of genes, contained in chromosones
Chromosones are found in the nucleus of every cell
Humans have 46 chromosones, coming in 23 pairs
You recieve 23 chromosones from your mum and dad each
Each pair is similar, But not identical (allele)
Sex - XY chromosones - Male / XX Chromosones - Female
Cell division - mitosis - Two identical daughter cells
Mitosis - Chromosones replicate - Same number of chromosones

Various types of protein such as Enzymes, Hormones, Antibodies
Proteins are made up of big long chains of amino acids, folded and coiled into a shape
Production of proteins is cotrolled by DNA
DNA can duplicate itself to produce copies
DNA has four bases (A/T, G/C), shaped in a double helix - sugar-phosphate backbone
DNA coding - read in triplets and then a protein is made accordingly
DNA Triplets known as a codon

Homeostatis - keeping conditions in the body constant
Need homeostatis for metabolism - optimum conditions
Homeostatis relies on hormones
Hormones - Chemical messengers, travel in the bloodstream
Glucose is the main source of energy
If glucose levels too high, insulin released
If gluscose levels are too low, glucagon released
Insulin converts glucose to glycogen (to the liver)
Glucagon converts glycoen back to glucose
If body produces litte or no insulin - Diabetes
Negative Feedback is the releasing of hormones - See Book
Type 1 Diabetes - Body stops producing insulin (common in young)
Type 2 Diabetes - body cells dont respond properly to insulin produced
Treatment of Type 1 - Injection with insulin, diet management, pancreatic tissue transplant
Treatment of Type 2 - Controlled with medication/diet
Temperature regulation - Thermoregulation - keeps enzymes' optimum
Too hot - Vasolidation, Sweating and Hair
Too Cold, Vasoconstriction, shivering and Hair
Negative feedback maintains optimum conditions inside the body
The purpose of the kidney is to regulate the water content of the blood
Not enough water - Dehydration and can be fatal
Chemical reactions in the body take place in an aqueous solution
Kidney also removes waste products from the blood
Urea is made in the liver as a byproduct of the breakdown of proteins
Urea is a poisonous substance that cannot be allowed to build up
Urea is removed by the kidney
Out to In - Cortex,(nephron), Medulla, Pelvis, ureter
Blood is brought to the kidney in the renal artery
The kidney regulates the water and salt and removes the urea
The filtered excess products form a liquid called urine
Urine travels down the ureters into the bladder
Purified blood returns through the renal vein
See Book For Nephron
Anti Diuretic Hormone - ADH regulates water reabsorbed by kidney
ADH released by the pituitry gland
More ADH means more water reabsorbed in the nephrons

Metals are conuctive, ductile, malleable and dense
If some metals are more reactive than others, they will push one out of their molecule
Fe + CuCl2 ===> FeCl2 + Cu would be a displacement reaction
Metal Extraction - stages: Mine the metal ore, Remove the waste rock, Remove the oxygen
Metal ore is a rock which contains a significant amount of metal
Iron Ore = Haematite = Iron Oxide
Lead Ore = Galena = Lead Sulphide
Aluminium = Bauxite = Aluminium Oxide
Gold is found as an element because it is very unreactive
Oxidation - Addition of oxygen to an element or compound
Reduction - Removal of oxygen from a compound
The Blast furnace is about reducing iron oxide to iron
Carbon is more reactive than iron, so displaces the iron in the blast furnace
Iron Oxide + Carbon --> Iron + Carbon Dioxide (2 Fe2 O3 + 3C --> 4Fe + 3CO2)
Blast Furnace - Carbon - Displaces the iron, and provides something to burn to generate heat
Blast Furnace - Iron ore - Provides the iron for the reaction
Blast Furnace - Limestone - Helps remove impurities in the form of slag
Blast Furnace - Oxygen (hot air) - Allows coke to burn providing the heat for the reaction
